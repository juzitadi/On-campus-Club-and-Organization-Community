# On-campus-Club-and-Organization-Community
The aim of this project is to solve poor publicity of club activity in XJTLU now. Now, the way that students know about and club publish their activities mainly rely on the email and leaflets. Under this situation, students may miss the concert and lectures they are interested while those valuable activities have only little audience too. To improve this problem and redefine the method for publishing, we designed the On-campus Club and Community System which is a website providing functions of activities information posting, viewing and booking. Since it combines the separate activities into consistency on the Internet, it would be more convenient for students to obtain information. Club would also have a powerful tool to advertise their activities based on the online platform. For each team member, the process of development was hard but valuable. It would not be easy to get quick access to those complex and unfamiliar knowledge. In addition, we also spent a lot of time on communicating ideas and resolve conflicts. Although the tasks were arduous, what we did make us really like real programmers to develop a software system at first time.
